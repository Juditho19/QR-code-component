## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (`:root`)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Utility classes


### What I learned

This was my third Frontend Mentor project, and I applied several key best practices that I learned from previous feedback:

- How to use `:root` variables for spacing, colours, and font control to make the design easier to maintain.
- Why avoiding fixed heights helps prevent content overflow.
- How to write clean, semantic HTML using tags like `<main>`, `<figure>`, and `<h1>` properly.
- The benefit of a mobile-first approach using `@media (min-width: â€¦)`.


Example code:

```css
:root {
  --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --pale-blue: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --radius: 0.625rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep improving in these areas:

-Structuring my CSS with comments and utility classes to stay DRY.

-Learning more about accessibility (like contrast ratios and better alt text).

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Mentor Challenges]([https://www.example.com](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)) - Great for real-world HTML/CSS practice.
